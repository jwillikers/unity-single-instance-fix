A fix for the Unity single instance issue on Linux that effects old Unity games.
The problem and fix are documented in Eike Sauer's blog post  {Fix-for-old-Unity-games-for-Linux-not-starting-anymore}.
This repository just provides prebuilt binaries for the fix so that you don't have to compile them yourself.

== Usage

This project provides binaries built via GitHub Actions which can be downloaded from the https://github.com/jwillikers/unity-single-instance-fix/releases/[Releases page].

. Download the shared library for the required architecture.
This command downloads the `x86_64` version of the library.
There are also `x86` and `aarch64` builds.
+
[,sh]
----
curl --location --remote-name https://github.com/jwillikers/unity-single-instance-fix/releases/download/1.0.0/libunity-single-instance-fix-x86_64.so
----

. Add the shared library to `LD_PRELOAD` path when running the game.
+
Command-line::
+
[,sh]
----
LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libunity-single-instance-fix-x86_64.so ./game.x86_64
----

Steam launch command::
+
[,sh]
----
LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libunity-single-instance-fix-x86_64.so %command%
----

== Develop

For compatibility with glibc, the GitHub Actions builds use the oldest supported Linux runners.
For development, Nix is used for reproducibility.
https://nixos.org/[Nix] is used to manage all of the necessary dependencies.
The `nix develop` command can be used to enter or run commands in an environment with all of the necessary dependencies.
For convenience, direnv can be used to automatically load this environment when entering the project's directory.
The https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mkhl.direnv[mkhl.direnv VSCode extension] integrates this environment in VSCode for development.
Nix also generates the configuration for https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit], which automates formatting and various checks when committing changes.

. Install an implementation of Nix, such as https://lix.systems[Lix] used here.
+
[,sh]
----
curl -sSf -L https://install.lix.systems/lix | sh -s -- install
----

. Clone the source code of this repository locally.
+
[,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/jwillikers/unity-single-instance-fix.git
----

. Then change into the project directory.
+
[,sh]
----
cd unity-single-instance-fix
----

. Install direnv for your system according to the https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html[direnv installation instructions].
+
[,sh]
----
sudo rpm-ostree install direnv
sudo systemctl reboot
----

. Integrate direnv with your shell by following the instructions on the https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html[direnv Setup page].

. Permit the direnv configuration in the repository.
+
[,sh]
----
direnv allow
----

. Build the shared library with Nix or the https://just.systems/[just] command runner.
+
Nix::
+
[,sh]
----
nix build
----

just::
+
[,sh]
----
just
